title: "moderna love (a poem)"
description: "based off a tweet: \"meet cute at the vaccination clinic call that moderna love\""
intro: "I wrote this on a night when I realized I hadn't written poetry in a very long time. Shoutout to my friend Jason who told me to write something, anything, and gave me only 8 minutes to do it (which turned to 15 minutes, then 20, then into something I'd pick at for several weeks after). I'm sitting here at 6 am, still recording for what feels like the hundredth time (which, at the time of writing this, I can't embed properly anyways). I guess this has been a lesson in accepting that perfection is asymptotic, and sooner or later I need to let go of my work."

`audio: /moderna-love.mp3`


boy meets girl for the first time\
in the middle of the parking lot\
upturned soda cans, downturned eyes\
we locked gazes in front of the vaccine line\
our shocked faces when we saw our matching times:\
\
4pm on a wednesday.

a responsible decision,\
and then a simple collision\
she dropped her keys next to me\
by the vitamins aisle in CVS\
sipping starbucks through her sleepiness\
a meet-cute with a sweet tooth.\
\
*what do they put in that coveted chemistry?*


i hope it runs through my bloodstream\
the way you run through my mind\
the way i said sorry but didn't even say hi\
the way you denied my need to apologize\
\
(*close your eyes, and you won't feel a thing*)\
would you wait for me?

(*which arm, right or left?*)\
was i right or had you left?\
\
(*please wait for 15 more minutes*)\
a sting, and then nothing.\
\
i'm not a fighter nor a pfizer\
you're the better half of a j&j\
maybe we were destined to meet\
but maybe it wasn't today.\
\
when i finally bring up the courage\
to rip the bandaid off my arm\
the imprint lingers like the memory\
of the place it all starts.\
\
perhaps it was the distance\
perhaps it was our signs\
perhaps it would've worked out\
in a more precedented time.\
\
but i'll cherish our\
hypothetical meet-cute\
and always remember\
how lovely\
it was\
to meet you,\
\
4pm on a wednesday.
