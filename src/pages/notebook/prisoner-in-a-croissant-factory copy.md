i know a lot of people are confused about my website title and why i'm so obsessed with this quote from Frank O'Hara in his poem Lines for the Fortune Cookies:

>You are a prisoner in a croissant factory and you love it.

when i first read this line, it hit me with this stupidly inarticulate sense of longing that i can't begin to describe, the kind of longing that makes you think for days, the kind that makes you set it as the title to your website in a font that's bigger than your own name. 

it's been a month or so since i've graduated, and i'm still waiting to be handed a magic key to the grandeur of adulthood, unlocking all the knowledge of how to deal with being hurt, where to find love, and knowing who to call when things go wrong.  people keep asking me what i want to do with myself and what kind of career i want and where i see myself in five, ten years. i think it's partly because of the environment i've always found myself in, full of people with big dreams and ambition—not to say that i'm devoid of those things, but i think it just manifests in a different way for me, in ways i don't think i'll ever be able to make a career out of. during times like these i would love for nothing more than to be a prisoner in a croissant factory, goals clearly defined, no one asking what *more* you're striving to be, and to love it all so much despite it all. 

there's a whole world out there for you to explore, but here you are, in your croissant factory, toiling away every day towards the same goal. there are no surprises, and all the consistency. every day it smells like butter, a little salty, a little sweet. the machines dance for you every day in the same metronomic rhythm. you watch butter become dough as it's piled on in never-ending layers, and you remember the magic you felt the first time you watched Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. everything is crafted with calculated thought and the pleasure of knowing all 27 layers of someone's breakfast. 

what's in a croissant factory and what's in a prison? maybe i'll never find a fancy job and change the world, and i shouldn't expect myself to be entitled to that. maybe it's okay to keep doing what i'm doing, to keep churning the butter and layering the dough without worrying about where this will take you in five years, without worrying about the metrics you'll get to add to your resume. maybe i'll always be stuck here doing the same simple things every day, but as long there's something i love, anything at all, it might not be too bad.

starting this blog is a commitment for myself to do all the things i've ever wanted to do, to all the dreams i've ever had and never bothered to start while i was stuck in paralysis and waiting for someone to tell me that what i've done is finally "good enough" to show other people. it's an ode to knowing i might spend my whole life making silly little croissants and working away at way too many hobbies which might never amount to any money, any impact, and that's okay.

as someone who was never really confident in themselves and maybe never will be, it's hard for me to think that what i have to say matters to anyone at all. i've always been all too reluctant and afraid of being vulnerable, hiding behind jokes and avoiding all questions whenever i could. i've had way too many thoughts i thought would make for a good blog post, poem, or article, but ultimately resolved to nothing but inaction and regretful afterthought. every day a small voice in my head grows louder, "is today when it'll turn around? what are you waiting for?" 

writing is something i've always loved and wanted to do. whether or not i'm good at it is a different story, and a story that doesn't necessarily need to be told. i don't think my opinions or experiences are particularly special, but i think a hidden implication of unspecialness is that it's familiar to many people. you could be adventurous and get a seasonal strudel at the local bakery...or you could get a croissant in bulk from the grocery store.

so i guess i'll be sitting in my factory, making croissants for both no one and everyone at the same time—they might be good or they might be completely awful, and i'll never really know unless it's so good or bad that they reach out to the factory for praise or complaints, but i'm just happy to have made you feel any way at all.
